# This job gets installed only if Grafana, Loki and Promtail are enabled.
#
# It's an ephemeral container running at the start and end of each Helm
# deploy and it's used to log at stdout the Helm revision we are
# installing / we finished installing.
#
# This datapoint is useful and can be very helpful as annotation
# in Grafana dashboard.
