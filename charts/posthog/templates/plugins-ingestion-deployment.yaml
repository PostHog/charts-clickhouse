    The ingestion deployments handle processing of analytic events e.g. captured
    via the `/e/` and similar endpoints.

    To allow for near real time processing of most of the events, we will divert
    some events that break certain criteria e.g. sending 1000s of events per
    second with the same distinct id to a separate consumer to be processed.
    This is consumer is run by the plugins-ingestion-overflow deployment and can
    be scaled independently.
