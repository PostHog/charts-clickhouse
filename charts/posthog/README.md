# PostHog Helm Chart

> :warning: **This chart is not ready yet** Be careful!

ðŸ¦” [PostHog](https://posthog.com/) is developer-friendly, open-source product analytics.

This chart bootstraps a [PostHog](https://posthog.com/) deployment on a [Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io) cluster using the [Helm](https://helm.sh) package manager. The chart uses the scalable [Clickhouse](https://clickhouse.tech/) database for powering analytics.

## Prerequisites

- Google Cloud kubernetes cluster
- Kubernetes 1.6+ with Beta APIs enabled
- helm >= v3

## Installing the Chart

To install the chart with the release name `posthog`:

```console
helm repo add posthog https://posthog.github.io/charts-clickhouse/
helm repo update
helm install -f values.yaml --timeout 20m posthog posthog/posthog
```

The command deploys PostHog on the Kubernetes cluster in the default configuration.

You can find a example `values.yaml` files as well as an overview of the parameters that can be configured during installation under [configuration](#configuration).

> **Tip**: List all releases using `helm list`

### Setting up static IP on google cloud

1. Open google cloud console
1. Go to VPC Networks > [External IP addresses](https://console.cloud.google.com/networking/addresses/list)
1. Add new static IP with the name `posthog`

### Setting up DNS

After the chart has started, you can look up the external ip via the following command:

```bash
kubectl get svc posthog
```

Create a CNAME record from your desired hostname to the external ip.

## Upgrading Chart

```console
helm repo update
helm upgrade -f values.yaml posthog posthog/posthog
```

_See [helm upgrade](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_upgrade/) for command documentation._


## Uninstalling the Chart

```console
$ helm delete posthog
```

_See [helm uninstall](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_uninstall/) for command documentation._

The command removes all the Kubernetes components associated with the chart and deletes the release.

## Dependencies

By default, the chart installs the following dependencies:

- [Altinity/clickhouse-operator](https://github.com/Altinity/clickhouse-operator/)
- [bitnami/postgresql](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/master/bitnami/postgresql)
- [bitnami/redis](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/master/bitnami/redis)
- [bitnami/kafka](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/master/bitnami/kafka)

There is optional support for the following additional dependencies:

- [kubernetes/ingress-nginx](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/)
- [jetstack/cert-manager](https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager)
- [prometheus-community/prometheus](https://github.com/prometheus-community/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/prometheus)
- [prometheus-community/prometheus-statsd-exporter](https://github.com/prometheus-community/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/prometheus-statsd-exporter)

See [configuration](#configuration) section for how to enable and configure each.

## Configuration

To install the chart, you need to prepare a `values.yaml` file.

Dependent charts can also have values overwritten. Preface values with postgresql.*, see options for each chart in [ALL_VALUES.md](ALL_VALUES.md) or under each charts repos in [Dependencies](#Dependencies).

All configuration options can be found in [ALL_VALUES.md](ALL_VALUES.md) or in [values.yaml](values.yaml) file.

### Example `values.yaml`

This `values.yaml` is geared towards minimizing cost on google kubernetes engine. Use it if you have less than 1M events/month.

```yaml
# Minimal settings for scale of 10k to 1M events/month.
# Note that this is experimental, please let us know how this worked for you.

cloud: gcp
ingress:
  hostname: "posthog.yourcloud.net"

clickhouseOperator:
  storage: 60Gi

postgresql:
  persistence:
    size: 20Gi

redis:
  master:
    size: 2Gi

kafka:
  persistence:
    size: 10Gi
  logRetentionBytes: _8_000_000_000

# Extra replicas for more loaded services
web:
  replicacount: 2

worker:
  replicacount: 2

plugins:
  replicacount: 2

pgbouncer:
  replicacount: 1
```

### Example configuration (>1M events/month)

This `values.yaml` is geared towards larger-scale installations cost on google kubernetes engine. Use it if you have less than 1M events/month.

```yaml
# Minimal settings for anything beyond 1M events/month scale.
# Note that this is experimental, please let us know how this worked for you.

cloud: gcp
ingress:
  hostname: "posthog.yourcloud.net"

clickhouseOperator:
  storage: 200Gi

postgresql:
  persistence:
    size: 60Gi

redis:
  master:
    size: 30Gi

kafka:
  persistence:
    size: 30Gi
  logRetentionBytes: _22_000_000_000

pgbouncer:
  hpa:
    enabled: true

web:
  hpa:
    enabled: true

beat:
  hpa:
    enabled: true

worker:
  hpa:
    enabled: true

plugins:
  hpa:
    enabled: true
```

### Clickhouse

TODO

### PostgreSQL

By default, PostgreSQL is installed as part of the chart. To use an external PostgreSQL server set `postgresql.enabled` to `false` and then set `postgresql.postgresHost` and `postgresql.postgresqlPassword`. The other options (`postgresql.postgresqlDatabase`, `postgresql.postgresqlUsername` and `postgresql.postgresqlPort`) may also want changing from their default values.

To avoid issues when upgrading this chart, provide `postgresql.postgresqlPassword` for subsequent upgrades. This is due to an issue in the PostgreSQL chart where password will be overwritten with randomly generated passwords otherwise. See https://github.com/helm/charts/tree/master/stable/postgresql#upgrade for more detail.

### Redis

By default, Redis is installed as part of the chart. To use an external Redis server/cluster set `redis.enabled` to `false` and then set `redis.host`. If your redis cluster uses password define it with `redis.password`, otherwise just omit it. Check the table above for more configuration options.

To avoid issues when upgrading this chart, provide `redis.password` for subsequent upgrades. Otherwise the redis pods will get recreated on every update, potentially incurring some downtime.

_See [ALL_VALUES.md](ALL_VALUES.md) and [redis chart](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/master/bitnami/redis) for full configuration options._

### Kafka

TODO

### Ingress

This chart provides support for Ingress resource. If you have an available Ingress Controller such as Nginx or Traefik you maybe want to set `ingress.enabled` to true and choose an `ingress.hostname` for the URL. Then, you should be able to access the installation using that address.

### Prometheus

This chart supports alerting. Set `prometheus.enabled` to true and set `prometheus.alertmanagerFiles` to the right configuration.

Read more at https://github.com/prometheus-community/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/prometheus and https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/latest/configuration/

#### Example configuration (pagerduty)

```yaml
prometheus:
  enabled: true

  alertmanagerFiles:
    alertmanager.yml:
      receivers:
        - name: default-receiver
          pagerduty_configs:
            - routing_key: YOUR_ROUTING_KEY
              description: "{{ range .Alerts }}{{ .Annotations.summary }}\n{{ end }}"

      route:
        group_by: [alertname]
        receiver: default-receiver
```

#### Getting access to prometheus frontend

This might be useful when checking out metrics. Figure out your prometheus-server pod name via `kubectl get pods --namespace NS` and run:
`kubectl --namespace NS port-forward posthog-prometheus-server-XXX 9090`

After this you should be able to access prometheus server on localhost.

## Common issues / questions

### Cannot connect to my posthog instance after creation

If DNS has been updated properly, check whether the SSL cert was created successfully.

This can be done via

```bash
gcloud beta --project yourproject compute ssl-certificates list
```

If this is showing the ssl cert as PROVISIONING, that means that the SSL cert is still being created. [Read more on how to troubleshoot google SSL certificates here](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/ssl-certificates/troubleshooting)

As a troubleshooting tool, you can allow http access by setting `ingress.gcp.forceHttps` and `web.secureCookies` both to false, but we recommend always accessing PostHog via https.

### How can I connect to my clickhouse instance

- Get the IP via `kubectl get svc`
- Username: `admin` or `clickhouse.user`
- Password: `clickhouse.password`
