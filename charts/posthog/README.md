# PostHog Helm Chart

### :warning: This chart is still under development! Proceed with caution.

-----

ðŸ¦” [PostHog](https://posthog.com/) is developer-friendly, open-source product analytics.

This chart bootstraps a [PostHog](https://posthog.com/) deployment on a [Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io) cluster using the [Helm](https://helm.sh) package manager. The chart uses the scalable [ClickHouse](https://clickhouse.tech/) database for powering analytics.

## Prerequisites

- [Google Cloud Kubernetes Engine (GKE)](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/)
- [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) 1.6+ with Beta APIs enabled
- [Helm](https://helm.sh/) >= v3

## Installing the chart

To install the chart with the release name `posthog`, run the following:

```console
helm repo add posthog https://posthog.github.io/charts-clickhouse/
helm repo update
helm install -f values.yaml --timeout 20m posthog posthog/posthog
```

The above command deploys PostHog on the Kubernetes cluster in the default configuration.

You can find an example `values.yaml` file as well as an overview of the parameters that can be configured during installation under [configuration](#configuration).

> **Tip**: List all releases using `helm list`

### Setting up a static IP on Google Cloud

1. Open the Google Cloud Console
1. Go to VPC Networks > [External IP addresses](https://console.cloud.google.com/networking/addresses/list)
1. Add new static IP with the name `posthog`

### Setting up DNS

After the chart has started, you can look up the external ip via the following command:

```bash
kubectl get svc posthog
```

Create a `CNAME` record from your desired hostname to the external IP.

## Upgrading the chart

```console
helm repo update
helm upgrade -f values.yaml posthog posthog/posthog
```

> See [the Helm docs](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_upgrade/) for documentation on the `helm upgrade` command.

When upgrading major versions, see [Upgrade notes](#upgrade-notes)


## Uninstalling the Chart

```console
$ helm uninstall posthog
```

> See [the Helm docs](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_uninstall/) for documentation on the `helm uninstall` command.

The command above removes all the Kubernetes components associated with the chart and deletes the release.

## Dependencies

By default, the chart installs the following dependencies:

- [Altinity/clickhouse-operator](https://github.com/Altinity/clickhouse-operator/)
- [bitnami/postgresql](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/master/bitnami/postgresql)
- [bitnami/redis](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/master/bitnami/redis)
- [bitnami/kafka](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/master/bitnami/kafka)

There is optional support for the following additional dependencies:

- [kubernetes/ingress-nginx](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/)
- [jetstack/cert-manager](https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager)
- [prometheus-community/prometheus](https://github.com/prometheus-community/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/prometheus)
- [prometheus-community/prometheus-statsd-exporter](https://github.com/prometheus-community/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/prometheus-statsd-exporter)

See [configuration](#configuration) section for how to enable and configure each.

## Configuration

To install the chart, you need to prepare a `values.yaml` file.

Dependent charts can also have values overwritten. Preface values with postgresql.*, see options for each chart in [ALL_VALUES.md](ALL_VALUES.md) or under each charts repos in [Dependencies](#Dependencies).

All configuration options can be found in [ALL_VALUES.md](ALL_VALUES.md) or in [values.yaml](values.yaml) file.

### Example `values.yaml` (<1M events/month)

<br />

This `values.yaml` is geared towards minimizing cost on google kubernetes engine. Use it if you have less than 1M events/month.

```yaml
# Minimal settings for scale of 10k to 1M events/month.
# Note that this is experimental, please let us know how this worked for you.

cloud: gcp
ingress:
  hostname: "posthog.yourcloud.net"

clickhouseOperator:
  storage: 60Gi

postgresql:
  persistence:
    size: 20Gi

redis:
  master:
    size: 2Gi

kafka:
  persistence:
    size: 10Gi
  logRetentionBytes: _8_000_000_000

# Extra replicas for more loaded services

### [ClickHouse](https://clickhouse.tech/)

TODO

### [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)

> While ClickHouse powers the bulk of the analytics if you deploy PostHog using this chart, Postgres is still needed as a data store for PostHog to work.

By default, PostgreSQL is installed as part of the chart. To use an external PostgreSQL server set `postgresql.enabled` to `false` and then set `postgresql.postgresHost` and `postgresql.postgresqlPassword`. The other options (`postgresql.postgresqlDatabase`, `postgresql.postgresqlUsername` and `postgresql.postgresqlPort`) may also want changing from their default values.

To avoid issues when upgrading this chart, provide `postgresql.postgresqlPassword` for subsequent upgrades. This is due to an issue in the PostgreSQL chart where password will be overwritten with randomly generated passwords otherwise. See https://github.com/helm/charts/tree/master/stable/postgresql#upgrade for more detail.

### [Redis](https://redis.io/)

By default, Redis is installed as part of the chart. To use an external Redis server/cluster set `redis.enabled` to `false` and then set `redis.host`. If your redis cluster uses password define it with `redis.password`, otherwise just omit it. Check the table above for more configuration options.

To avoid issues when upgrading this chart, provide `redis.password` for subsequent upgrades. Otherwise the redis pods will get recreated on every update, potentially incurring some downtime.

_See [ALL_VALUES.md](ALL_VALUES.md) and [redis chart](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/master/bitnami/redis) for full configuration options._

### [Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/)

TODO

### [Ingress](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/)

This chart provides support for Ingress resource. If you have an available Ingress Controller such as Nginx or Traefik you maybe want to set `ingress.enabled` to true and choose an `ingress.hostname` for the URL. Then, you should be able to access the installation using that address.

### [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/overview/)

This chart supports alerting. Set `prometheus.enabled` to true and set `prometheus.alertmanagerFiles` to the right configuration.

Read more at https://github.com/prometheus-community/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/prometheus and https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/latest/configuration/

#### Example configuration ([PagerDuty](https://www.pagerduty.com/))

```yaml
prometheus:
  enabled: true

  alertmanagerFiles:
    alertmanager.yml:
      receivers:
        - name: default-receiver
          pagerduty_configs:
            - routing_key: YOUR_ROUTING_KEY
              description: "{{ range .Alerts }}{{ .Annotations.summary }}\n{{ end }}"

      route:
        group_by: [alertname]
        receiver: default-receiver
```

#### Getting access to the Prometheus UI

This might be useful when checking out metrics. Figure out your `prometheus-server` pod name via `kubectl get pods --namespace NS` and run:
`kubectl --namespace NS port-forward posthog-prometheus-server-XXX 9090`.

After this you should be able to access prometheus server on `localhost`.

## Common issues / questions

### I cannot connect to my PostHog instance after creation

If DNS has been updated properly, check whether the SSL certificate was created successfully.

This can be done via the following command:

```bash
gcloud beta --project yourproject compute ssl-certificates list
```

If running the command shows the SSL cert as `PROVISIONING`, that means that the certificate is still being created. [Read more on how to troubleshoot Google SSL certificates here](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/ssl-certificates/troubleshooting)

As a troubleshooting tool, you can allow HTTP access by setting `ingress.gcp.forceHttps` and `web.secureCookies` both to false, but we recommend always accessing PostHog via https.

### How can I connect to my ClickHouse instance?

- Get the IP via `kubectl get svc`
- Username: `admin` or `clickhouse.user`
- Password: `clickhouse.password`


### Releasing a new version of this helm chart

Simply apply one of the following labels to your PR _before merging_ to bump the version and release it to the helm repo:
- `bump patch`
- `bump minor`
- `bump major`

## Upgrade notes

### Upgrading from 1.x.x

2.0.0 updated redis chart in an incompatible way. If your upgrade fails with

```
Upgrade "posthog" failed: cannot patch "posthog-posthog-redis-master" with kind StatefulSet: StatefulSet.apps "posthog-posthog-redis-master" is invalid: spec: Forbidden: updates to statefulset spec for fields other than 'replicas', 'template', and 'updateStrategy' are forbidden
```

Run the following and `helm upgrade` again: `kubectl delete --namespace NAMESPACE sts posthog-posthog-redis-master`
